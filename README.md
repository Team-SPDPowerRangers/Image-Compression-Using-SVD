# Image-Compression-Using-SVD
Images are compressed based on Singular Value Decomposition in both MATLAB and Python programming languages

## Description
In todayâ€™s world there are many images which would be sent as digital information every second and with the development in the technology there is also an rise in that. These transmitted images require a lot of storage and to reduce the storage we are compressing the image. In our project we are compressing the image for both the grey scale image and also an colour image. In the case of the grey scaled image we directly compress it using the singular value decomposition method and then we are using the sparse matrices where we convert the matrix into a sparse matrix and the we use sparse matrices to remove the unnecessary values in the data present in that image. While in the case of the colour image we are splitting the colour image into three different part which are on the red scale, the blue scale and the green scale after the splitting of the image into three different image we then compress those image using the singular value decomposition and then we are using the sparse matrices where we convert the matrix into an sparse matrix and the sparse matrices are used to remove the unnecessary data from those images and finally we combine those three images to get the compressed colour image. And we implemented our project in 2 programming languages which are Python and MATLAB.
